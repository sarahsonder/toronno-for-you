            <p>
                Hi! We're a team of two Vancouverites, one Guelphite, and one Mississaugan. We all study
                at the University of Toronto and are greatly fond of public transit. We wish we had a
                resource detailing Toronto's transit system when we first started university, so we built
                one ourselves. We hope ToronnoForYou will help you find your way around Toronto!
            </p>
